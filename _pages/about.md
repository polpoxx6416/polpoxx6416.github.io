Hi, I'm Paul Brehat, a final-year dual-degree student in Metz at CentraleSupelec seeking an end-of-studies internship in the tech sector, with a focus on data roles. You can find my academic projects in the [projects section](/al-folio/publications/) and my detailed CV in the [cv section](/al-folio/cv/).
