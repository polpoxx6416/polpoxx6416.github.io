# PKMN

This project is an app inspired by [glow.li](https://glow.li) that make random pokemons from gen 4 appear in your terminal ! 

It is fully local and you don't need curl to do so, hence it is useful in an environment where you don't have access to internet on your dev machines.

I only added pokemons from gen 4 because it is my favorite but feel free to add pokemons from whatever generation you like !

Go grab it [here](https://github.com/polpoxx6416/pkmn)
